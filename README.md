## Analysis of School Data

School Performance Overview:

The dataset includes information on 15 schools, with a total of 39,170 students and a total budget of $24,649,428. The average math score is 70.34, and the average reading score is 69.98. The percentage of students passing math is 86.08%, passing reading is 84.43%, and overall passing is 72.81%.
School Summary:

By breaking down the data on a school level, we can observe variations in performance across different institutions. Notably, Griffin High School, Cabrera High School, and Bailey High School stand out with high overall passing percentages of 81.34%, 80.79%, and 80.08%, respectively.
Performance by School Type:

When comparing school performance by type, independent schools tend to outperform government schools in both math and reading scores as well as overall passing percentages.
Performance by Budget per Student:

Schools with a lower budget per student (<$585) have a higher overall passing percentage (76.72%) compared to schools with higher budgets per student, showcasing a potential positive correlation between budget allocation and student performance.
Performance by School Size:

Smaller schools (<1000 students) demonstrate higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing percentages compared to medium and large-sized schools.
Performance by School Type:

Independent schools show higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing percentages compared to government schools.
Conclusions:

Budget Impact:

The budget per student does appear to have an impact on academic performance. Schools with lower budgets per student tend to have higher overall passing percentages. This suggests that efficient budget allocation might contribute to better student outcomes.
School Size Matters:

Smaller schools tend to outperform medium and large-sized schools in terms of academic achievement. This could be due to more personalized attention and a sense of community in smaller educational settings.
